Digital Asset Metadata Sidecar
==============================

This repository contains a XML Schema defining a digital asset metadata sidecar.
The idea of this sidecar is to accompany any kind of digital asset that may be archived in a computer museum.

Also the repository contains autogenerated C#, VisualBasic.NET and Java code.

The sidecar schema is under public domain as long as any change you made is compatible and upstreamed,
or you change the root element type from CICMMetadata to anything else.
Besides that, you can use it anywhere.

If you want to give due credit, this schema is created by Natalia Portillo.

The schema is set-oriented, that is, each sidecar file should accompany a single set, that can contain one or
more of the following elements (or newer ones):
* Magazines
* Books
* User manuals, user guides, installation guides, instruction manuals
* Optical discs (CD and successors)
* Advertisements
